        - "If you have nape-style elastics, pull both loops over your head. The top loop goes over your ears, the bottom loop goes under your ears. If you need to add a knot, do so conservatively. The elastic should just barely hold the mask in place. If your over-tighten, the nose wire might hurt."

  items:
    - question: "How do fabric masks protect you?"
      answers: 
        - "It is important to understand that a fabric mask will not make you invincible to the coronavirus. Its effectiveness is that it reminds you to not touch your face, it tells others to keep their distance, and it can block unexpected sneezes. You must continue to keep distance from others and to wash your hands frequently."

    - question: "How do I wash my mask?"
      answers: 
        - "It is best to hand wash your mask. In the most recent version (after May, 28 2020), I updated to a much more comfortable and pliable nose wire. However, I am a bit concerned that it might not hold up in the clothes washer, even on gentle cycle. Please let me know if you have problems with the soft nose wire. NOTE: You do not need to wash your mask daily as long as your sterilize it."

If the elastic melts, email me and I will send you a replacement. Do not tumble dry."

    - question: "Why is the lingerie bag so important? Why can’t I toss it in the dryer with my clothes?"
      answers: 
        - "If the mask is thrown in your washer and dryer along with a regular load, your clothes will become entangled in the elastic and the nose wire will eventually pop out. This is why I recommend hand washing your mask and not tumbling it dry."

    - question: "Do you have any filters? What should I put in the pocket? "
      answers: 
        - "The ProperFit mask is designed to hold a PM2.5 filter. Sorry, I cannot supply these. Maybe you will get lucky and find some online. Or you could fold a tissue or cut a paper towel (to ~3.5” x 5”) and slide it in there. Or you could get fancy and google ProperFit’s instructions on “How to Make PM2.5 Filters.” At t=6:50, the video covers the super easy DIY filters. Also, note that the mask does not have to have a filter to offer protection. It still has 2 layers of cotton (as recommended by the CDC) plus a layer of featherweight interfacing."

    - question: "I can’t breathe through the mask!"
      answers: 
        - "I apologize if you ended up with a suffocating mask. Striking the right balance of effective filtering and breathability has been an ongoing challenge. Here are a few things to try: First, wash the mask several times. Soap and water will dissolve the layer of glue from the fusible interfacing, but the interfacing (which is lightweight, good for filtration, and breathable) will remain. Next, try placing a paper towel in the pocket. Cut a piece to 5 x 3.5 inches and slide it in the pocket. The paper will separate the layers of cotton so they don’t stick together when you breathe in. If you try these things and your mask is still too impermeable, let me know and I will make a new one for you."

    - question: "The nose wire is too painful! What can I do?"
      answers: 
        - "First try re-adjusting the nose wire. It should be molded so that pressure is on your cheeks, not on your delicate nose bridge. Next, be sure the elastic straps are not too tight behind your head. They should be almost loose - tightened just barely enough to keep the mask from falling off your face. Over-tightened elastic will result in a very painful nose wire. Another possibility is that you have an early version of my masks where I was using a larger nose wire. You can snip it out (cut threads, not fabric) and try replacing it with a softer twist tie. Or contact me and I will send you an updated version with a kinder nose wire."

    - question: "$25 or $35 for a mask? Isn’t that kind of pricey?"
      answers:
        - "This is a fundraiser, not a profit making venture. I am donating my time and going above and beyond to make the highest quality fabric masks possible. In return, I ask that you also go above and beyond in your generosity to Feeding America."
    - question: "I need a lot of masks FAST! Can you help me?"
      answers: 
        - "I make each mask to order, so it is very difficult for me to turn out more than say 15 masks in a hurry. If you need a lot of masks in a short amount of time, I recommend you contact my cousin’s store, Van Ginkel Athletic Co."
      image: ""  
    - question: "Can you make masks with fabric ties rather than elastic?"
      answers: 
        - "Yes, I can make masks with fabric ties, but I recommend that you first check out my sister in law’s Etsy Shop, Silvertwigdesign. Her mask pattern includes fabric ties, a nose wire, and a filter pocket. She is an architect so, as you can imagine, she uses beautiful fabrics and she is a stickler for detail. She also donates proceeds to Feeding America."
