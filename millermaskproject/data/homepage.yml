    - "Miller Mask Project is fighting the coronavirus by sewing high-quality, well-designed fabric face masks in exchange for donations to Hunger Relief organizations such as Feeding America. This project is entirely self-funded and no payments other than donations are accepted."
    - "The masks you see on this site were made from a Properfit Clothing pattern. Each one is made to order, as the fabric selections change constantly.  The suggested minimum donation for a Properfit mask is $25 each."
    - "I am also offering more simple accordion masks made by my cousin Joe Van Ginkel of Van Ginkel Athletic Manufacturing Company of Des Moines, Iowa. The suggested minimum donation for an accordion mask is $10 each."
    - "Can I sew a mask for you?  If you know me, contact me and I will let you know how far out I am scheduling. I apologize that I cannot open up orders to the general public at this time."

  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  items:
    - question: "How do I wash my mask, and how often?"
      answers: 
        - "Wash your mask whenever it is convenient or if it gets smelly. Either hand wash it in hot soapy water or put it in a lingerie bag in your clothes washer."
      image: ""
    - question: "Why is the lingerie bag so important?  Why can’t I throw it in with my regular laundry?"
      answers: 
        - "If the mask is thrown in your washer and dryer along with a regular wash, your clothes will become entangled in the elastic and the nose wire in the mask will eventually pop out. This is why I recommend washing your mask in a lingerie bag and not tumbling it dry."
      image: ""
    - question: "Can I hang it to dry?"
      answers: 
        - "Yes, you can hang it to dry, but the mask might not be completely virus free. The best way to kill any lingering virus particles is to heat the mask to at least 170 for 30 minutes. Most dryers, on high heat, get to 170-180F. So that is why I recommend putting it in your oven at 200F for 30 minutes. No virus can survive that heat."
      image: ""
    - question: "I can’t breathe through the mask! My breathing sucks from around the edges. Is that ok?"
      answers: 
        - "Sorry, that was a fabric selection error on my part. You must have one of the masks that I made with a super high thread count nonallergenic pillow case cover. I had thought the material would be perfect, but apparently it is just a bit too impermeable. It would be better if your breathing is filtered through the material. To fix this, cut a hole (about 2 x 3”) in the center liner panel.  Find a piece of 100% cotton - an old dishtowel or pillowcase - and stitch it back over the hole."
      image: ""
    - question: "The nose wire is too painful! What can I do?"
      answers: 
        - "If your mask is one of my earlier versions, I was using 12 gauge wire which is relatively thick. Apparently, this size wire is uncomfortable for a lot of people, so I apologize. I have since switched to paper clips (when straightened are 6” long). I suggest changing out your wire.  Along the top binding, snip the thread only (being careful to not snip the fabric), until you can remove the wire.  Replace it with a straightened paper clip and stitch it shut."

    - question: "How much should I donate to this FeedingAmerica fundraiser?"
      answers:
        - "Very loose guidelines only, no contribution is too large or too small:"
      answerlist: 
        - "You are out of work and can’t pay your rent, you are an essential worker and have been under appreciated and underpaid until this crisis, or you are over 75 years old: $0"
        - "Your work has been cut back, the budget is tight, but you are not worried about where your next meal is coming from: $25/mask"
        - "Your refrigerators are packed and you have been spending the majority of your days watching Netflix: $50/mask"
        - "You did not cancel your spring break plans despite the warnings: $100/mask"
        - "Your business is booming and you can’t believe your good luck: $200/mask"

  content: "\"The mission of the Miller Mask Project is to fight the coronavirus on two fronts: covering people’s faces and raising money to help feed the most vulnerable Americans. This project is entirely self-funded. I am a one-woman operation, and I have been cutting and sewing for over 10 hours a day, 7 days a week since March 21st. The masks I make are more involved than the standard accordion masks, each one taking me over an hour to make. I am going the extra mile, and I hope you will too.\" -- Nancy"
