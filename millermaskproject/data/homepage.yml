  title : "Keep Your Mask Virus-Free"
  items:
    - title: BAKE IT
      content:
        - "The easiest way to keep your mask virus-free is to heat it to 170F for 30 minutes. You can do this in your dryer (on a dryer shelf, set to highest heat) or in your oven (on a dishtowel on a cookie sheet). You do not need to wash it first. Simply pop it in your pre-heated oven, set a timer for 30 minutes, and your mask will be virus-free and ready for its next use."
    - title: SPRAY IT
      content:
        - "Hand wash your mask when it looks dirty or whenever convenient for you. I recommend spraying it with an EPA approved disinfecting cleaner such as Fantastik® All-Purpose Cleaner. (Avoid disinfectants with bleach.) Let the disinfectant sit for 5-10 minutes before rinsing. Drip dry or “bake it” to accelerate drying."
    - title: BE GENTLE
      content:
        - "You can wash your mask in your clothes washer if you do so carefully. Put it in a lingerie bag and use the gentlest cycle. Do not tumble dry. The elastics will tangle with your clothes and the nose wire could be damaged. Do not put your mask in a microwave oven."

  items:
    - question: "How do fabric masks protect you?"
      answers: 
        - "It is important to understand that a fabric mask will not make you invincible to the coronavirus. Its effectiveness is that it reminds you to not touch your face, it tells others to keep their distance, and it can block unexpected sneezes. You must continue to keep distance from others and to wash your hands frequently."

    - question: "How do I wash my mask?"
      answers: 
        - "I recommend that you hand wash your masks. Spray with a non-bleaching, EPA approved disinfecting cleaner such as Fantastik® All-Purpose Cleaner. Let sit for 5 minutes, rinse and drip dry. Note that you do not need to wash it everyday if you “bake it.” "  
      image: ""
    - question: "What do you mean “bake it”?"
      answers: 
        - "If you subject your mask to 170F for 30 minutes (or 150F for 60 minutes), any virus particles will be killed. I find this very convenient. Every time I return from errands, I pop my mask in my pre-heated 170F oven and set a timer for 30 minutes. Oven temps can vary, so if you end up with melted elastic, email me and I will send you a new piece. Do NOT put your mask in a microwave oven. There is metal in the mask."
      image: ""    
    - question: "Why can’t I throw it in my washer?"
      answers: 
        - "Your mask has a fragile nose wire (it is a trade off between comfort and durability). But you can use your clothes washer as long as you are careful. Put the mask in a lingerie bag and set the washer on the gentlest cycle. Inspect the mask after it is washed. If the nose wire seems to be significantly bent out of shape, then it would be best to hand wash it. Do not tumble dry, even in a lingerie bag."
      image: ""
    - question: "Do you have any filters? What should I put in the pocket?"
      answers: 
        - "The ProperFit mask is designed to hold a PM2.5 filter. Sorry, I cannot supply these. Maybe you will get lucky and find some online. Or you could fold a tissue or cut a paper towel (to ~3.5” x 5”) and slide it in there. Or you could get fancy and google ProperFit’s instructions on “How to Make PM2.5 Filters.” At t=6:50, the video covers the super easy DIY filters. Also, note that the mask does not have to have a filter to offer protection. It still has 2 layers of cotton (as recommended by the CDC) plus a layer of featherweight interfacing."

    - question: "I can’t breathe through the mask!"
      answers: 
        - "I apologize if you ended up with a suffocating mask. Striking the right balance of effective filtering and breathability has been an ongoing challenge. Here are a few things to try: First, wash the mask several times. Soap and water will dissolve the layer of glue from the fusible interfacing, but the interfacing (which is lightweight, good for filtration, and breathable) will remain. Next, try placing a paper towel in the pocket. Cut a piece to 5 x 3.5 inches and slide it in the pocket. The paper will separate the layers of cotton so they don’t stick together when you breathe in. If you try these things and your mask is still too impermeable, let me know and I will make a new one for you."

    - question: "The nose wire is too painful! What can I do?"
      answers: 
        - "First try re-adjusting the nose wire. It should be molded so that pressure is on your cheeks, not on your delicate nose bridge. Next, be sure the elastic straps are not too tight behind your head. They should be almost loose - tightened just barely enough to keep the mask from falling off your face. Over-tightened elastic will result in a very painful nose wire. Another possibility is that you have an early version of my masks where I was using a larger nose wire. You can snip it out (cut threads, not fabric) and try replacing it with a softer twist tie. Or contact me and I will send you an updated version with a kinder nose wire."

    - question: "$25 or $35 for a mask? Isn’t that kind of pricey?"
      answers:
        - "This is a fundraiser. And, as is the nature of fundraisers, one person goes above and beyond in donating time and skills, and another person goes above and beyond in their generousity to the designated charity."
    - question: "I need a lot of masks FAST! Can you help me?"
      answers: 
        - "I make each mask to order, so it is very difficult for me to turn out more than say 15 masks in a hurry. If you need a lot of masks in a short amount of time, I recommend you contact my cousin’s store, Van Ginkel Athletic Co."
      image: ""  
    - question: "Can you make masks with fabric ties rather than elastic?"
      answers: 
        - "Yes, I can make masks with fabric ties, but I recommend that you first check out my sister in law’s Etsy Shop, Silvertwigdesign. Her mask pattern includes fabric ties, a nose wire, and a filter pocket. She is an architect so, as you can imagine, she uses beautiful fabrics and she is a stickler for detail. She also donates proceeds to Feeding America."
